## SECOND HALF 
- ✅ Time Complexity
```
When analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm we may find three cases: best-case, average-case and worst-case. Let’s understand what it means.

Suppose we have the following unsorted list [1, 5, 3, 9, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8] and we need to find the index of a value in this list using linear search.

best-case: this is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input. In our example, the best case would be to search for the value 1. Since this is the first value of the list, it would be found in the first iteration.

average-case: this is the average complexity of solving the problem. This complexity is defined with respect to the distribution of the values in the input data. Maybe this is not the best example but, based on our sample, we could say that the average-case would be when we’re searching for some value in the “middle” of the list, for example, the value 2.

worst-case: this is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size n. In our example, the worst-case would be to search for the value 8, which is the last element from the list.
