Django REST framework
Conclusion
A web framework is a tool that can be used to quickly create a
web application. All the code needed for the heavy lifting is already
done in a framework and all we need to do is write the code
specific to your application. Virtual environments are the key to
keeping the dependencies separated so that we can work on
different projects at the same time.
- i learnt how to create virtual environments and how to use them & also how to create a Django powered project.
- i learnt to run the server and start your Django project. 
- i know what files are created when you create a project in Django.
- i also learnt not perfactly but concluded what a framework is and what to expect out of it.
